        desc:`In a push toward modern infrastructure, several African cities have begun early testing of Smart Road 
        Technology — digitally enhanced roads capable of detecting traffic flow, 
        alerting drivers of hazards,and reducing accidents using AI-powered sensors.
    According to local engineers, the pilot project integrates solar-powered road panels,
     micro-sensors, and real-time traffic reporting designed to help reduce
      congestion and improve emergency response times`
